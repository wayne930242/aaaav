/**
 * pi extension: inside an open loop, asks Jev to check the phase machine's reading of the loop book. The
 * program computes the next phase from the book's evidence; Jev sees the kind, intent, anchor, diff
 * summary, phase (current, next, missing), verify state, open todos, tasks, and friction, and judges only
 * whether the current phase's completion condition truly holds and whether to advance, go back, or ask
 * the user. It runs when a run settles and the book gained an entry since the last judgment, and at a
 * `close` declaration. The advisory is one line leading with `next → <phase>`; it continues the run once
 * when Jev agrees to advance and the next phase is a verify, review, or fix. A run that arranged a wake
 * (a monitor, a loop, a subagent) is waiting, not finished, and is not judged. Outside a loop nothing
 * runs, nor in a `quick` loop, whose only prompt is the close reminder; a subagent session registers
 * nothing, since the agent that spawned it judges its result.
