# Pause

**You own a clean stop a cold-start agent can resume from.** Runs only on an explicit pause, going offline, a restart, or imminent compaction; "keep going" is not a pause.

1. Stop at a safe boundary: finish or back out of the current step, start nothing new, and stop the subagents and monitors you started.
2. Take no irreversible action to pause: no new push, PR, or deploy.
3. Commit uncommitted work as one `wip:` commit on the current branch; when the tree is broken, say so in one line of the commit body.
4. Write `scratch/resume-<task-slug>.md`: intent, what is done and verified, current state, the next action, key files, and gotchas. Point to the decision trail instead of copying it.

**Reply:** where the run stopped, the `wip:` commit and whether the tree is clean, what lives only in the resume note, and the first action on resume.
