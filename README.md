# pi-anchorloop

[繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

Agent workflow skills and loop extensions for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Every main task type enters through its own skill, picks a playbook, and runs one shared loop: **Align → Anchor → Act → Verify**.

## Skills

```

- **`anchorloop`** holds what is true for every task type: restate the task, pick the entry's playbook, keep real work items in `todo` (its first create opens a loop), declare the loop with `anchorloop_stage` (kind, intent, anchor command) before the first change, work in small increments deleting before adding, verify against the anchor, and record friction in the loop book. The Reflexive pass hands reflected friction to `solid-loop`. `PRINCIPLES.md` names the principles playbooks cite and the user can steer with. The lifecycle playbooks cover unattended runs, clean pauses, and picking up a prior run.
- **Entry skills** each name the anchor for their task type and index their playbooks. A playbook has an ownership line, numbered steps, and a `Reply:` line that sets what the final report contains.
- **Shared skills** are called by entries: `grilling` for user-owned decisions, `domain-modeling` for terms and ADRs, `human-feedback` for reactions to working output, `agent-terse` for text only agents read: briefs, reports, and agent messages.

## Extensions

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pi/book.ts` | The loop book. The first `todo` create opens a loop, so it needs the `todo` tool of [`@juicesharp/rpiv-todo`](https://github.com/juicesharp/rpiv-mono/tree/main/packages/rpiv-todo#readme) (its `tool_result` details `{tasks, nextId}` and `rpiv-todo-state` entries); without it no loop opens. The agent declares only what the extension cannot observe with `anchorloop_stage`: `kind` (`quick`, `inline`, `reviewed`, `durable`, with an intent and the anchor command), `verify` (a check that is not a command), `fresh-read`, `friction` (`tried`, `found`, `led_by`), `reflect`, `skip`, `back`, `close`, and the query `read`. Everything else is read from evidence: production edits, the exit code of the bash call that ran the anchor command (failed-then-passed runs become retry pairs), reviewer `Blocking: P0=<n> P1=<m>` counts, summaries of `docs/specs/*/` artifacts as they are edited, and a returned subagent that Jev judges to have been a fresh-context read of the spec. A phase machine over that evidence gives each kind a fixed sequence (`quick` act → check; `inline` anchor → act → verify; `reviewed` adds review; `durable` adds decide → grill → spec → read → approve → design; every kind ends with reflect → close), and `read` shows `<kind> · phase <current> ✓ → <next> (missing: …) · skipped: …`. A phase that starts before an earlier one is complete warns once in one line and names the `skip` escape; phases regress when evidence changes or on `back`. The book also records each todo with its `anchor`, `ref` (`<path>#<heading>`, resolved to line ranges), and `followup` metadata. One YAML book per open loop lives under `~/.pi/agent/anchorloop/books/` (`ANCHORLOOP_BOOKS_DIR` overrides it), subagent books under `agents/` (a child that closes keeps its book for the main session); `session_start` sweeps books whose session is gone. `close` never refuses over phases or friction, only while a pending or in-progress todo lacks `metadata.followup` (a ticket id, `memory`, or `drop — <reason>`). |
| `pi/anchor-gate.ts` | Inside an open loop, shows one warning line when `write` or `edit` starts the `act` phase while an earlier phase of the loop kind is incomplete: no anchor (`anchor` on the `kind` call, a `Reality anchor:` line, or a skip), and in a `durable` loop a missing decision, spec, fresh read, approval, or design, read from the `docs/specs/<folder>/` files (found from the book, the intent, or a todo `ref`). It warns again only when a new phase goes missing; the call still goes through. Outside a loop and in `quick` loops it stays silent. `.md`, `.txt`, and `.html` files, `scratch/`, `docs/specs/`, and temp files outside the project pass silently. Edits made through `bash` are not checked. |
| `pi/decision-tool.ts` | The `anchorloop_decision` tool appends single-line, spreadsheet-safe rows to a decision trail TSV, or a `start` row when a run picks up another run's trail. |
| `pi/second-thought.ts` | Inside an open loop, asks Jev (TypeSafe's typed-decision model, through pi's classifier registry) to check the phase machine when a run settles and the loop book gained an entry since the last judgment, and at a `close` declaration. The program computes the next phase from the book; Jev sees the kind, intent, anchor, diff summary (≤1200 chars), `phase` (current, next, missing), verify state, open todos, the task list, and friction (a child's under its name), and judges only whether the current phase's completion truly holds (`complete`) and whether to `advance`, go `back`, or `ask-user`, plus `done`, the review tier still needed, and quality. The one-line advisory leads with `next → <phase>`; a retry pair with no friction entry adds a `friction` hint. The run continues once, only when Jev agrees to advance and the next phase is a verify, review, or fix; an advisory identical to the last one is not repeated, and a `full` rating after a clean review that follows the last change shows a note instead of a recheck. A run that called `MonitorCreate`, `LoopCreate`, `goal_wait`, or a `subagent` tool is waiting and is not judged. Without a TypeSafe key it does nothing, and outside a loop it never runs. In a subagent session (`PI_SUBAGENT_ID` from pi-herdr-agents, or `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD` from pi-subagents) it registers nothing, since the agent that spawned it judges the result. |
| `pi/validate-tool-use.ts` | After each `write` or `edit`, validates the file in-process (`pi/support/validators.ts`, a port of `hooks/validators/`) and appends suggestions for `SKILL.md`, instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `rules/`), and `docs/specs/` artifacts. Needs no Python; the Python validators in `hooks/` remain for `validate_all.py` and the parity test. |
| `pi/ttsr.ts` | A port of oh-my-pi's Time Traveling Stream Rules. A Markdown rule in `~/.pi/agent/rules/` or `<project>/.pi/rules/` whose frontmatter has a `condition` regex is watched during the run. A match in streamed assistant text aborts the response, drops it, and retries with the rule injected; a match in tool arguments (the command for `bash`, the new text for `write` and `edit`) blocks the call with the rule as its reason. Frontmatter fields follow oh-my-pi: `condition`, `scope` (`text`, `thinking`, `tool`, `tool:bash`, `tool:edit(*.ts)`), `globs`, and `interruptMode` (`always`, `prose-only`, `tool-only`, `never`), plus `repeatMode` (`once` or `after-gap`) and `repeatGap`. A rule fires once per session by default. `astCondition`, `question`, and `agents` are not supported; a rule that uses them is skipped and reported. `/ttsr` lists the loaded rules. |

## Install

Install the npm package `pi-anchorloop`; it is the recommended way to use anchorloop:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-anchorloop
```

A local checkout loads in place, so edits take effect on `/reload`:

```bash
pi install /path/to/anchorloop
```

## Develop

```bash
uv run python hooks/validate_all.py .   # skills, rules, and durable specs
uv run --with pytest pytest -q          # validators and the pi extensions (needs node)
```
